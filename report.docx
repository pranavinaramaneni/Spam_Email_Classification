Spam Email Classification Using Machine Learning

INTRODUCTION:

Spam emails are unwanted messages that cause inconvenience and security risks. This project aims to automatically classify emails as spam or legitimate using machine learning techniques.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Manual filtering of spam emails is inefficient. An automated spam detection system is required to accurately identify spam messages.

DATASET DESCRIPTION:

The SMS Spam Collection Dataset consists of labeled messages categorized as spam or ham. The dataset is widely used for text classification tasks.

METHODOLOGY:

Text preprocessing is applied to clean the data. TF-IDF is used to convert text into numerical features. The Naive Bayes algorithm is trained to classify emails.

ALGORITHM USED:

Naive Bayes Classifier
TF-IDF Vectorization

RESULTS:

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 96%, indicating strong classification performance.

CONCLUSION:

The spam email classifier effectively detects spam messages and can be applied in real-world email filtering systems.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

Deep Learning models

Web application using Flask

Real-time email filtering
